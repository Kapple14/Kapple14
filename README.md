# Welcome to my personal Github repository!

I am Karl Miklautz and I have been working on various programming projects during my Bachelor's and Master's studies. 
Most of them have been coded in Python and are clearly related to data analysis tasks. 
 
 ## Background
 
I started programming at the age of sixteen with C. 
Back then I was enrolled in the advanced computer science course offered by my high school. 
After completing high school I enrolled in the Bachelor's program ["Physics"](https://www.ph.tum.de/academics/bsc/curriculum_2008/) of the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de).
During this program my computer and espacially my data analysis skills have improved drastically.
After completing the Bachelor's program I enrolled in the Master's program ["Applied and Engineering Physics"](https://www.ph.tum.de/academics/msc/physics/).
During the master's program I started to administrate the IT infrastructure of the [DIM](http://dimiklautz.at).
Furthermore, I performed student interns to enhance my laboratory and pratical skills.
