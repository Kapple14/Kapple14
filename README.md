# Welcome to my personal Github repository!

My name is Karl Miklautz and I have been working on various programming projects during my Bachelor's and Master's studies. 
Most of them have been coded in Python due to their clear relation to data analysis for a scientific background. 
Here I like to present You some of them as part of this repository.
 
 ## Background
 
 My first coding experiences started at the age of 16, when I began to learn the basic in C. 
 Back then I was enrolled in the advanced computer science course offered by my high school. 
 After completing high school I enrolled in the undergraduate program "Physics" of the Technical University of Munich.
 During this program my computer science and espacially my data analysis skills have improved drastically.
 After completing the undergraduate course I enrolled into the Master's program "Applied and Engineering Physics", during which I started to mantain the IT infrastructure of the DIM.
 Furthermore, I performed working student positions to enhance my laboratory and pratical skills.
