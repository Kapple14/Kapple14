# Welcome to my personal Github repository!

My name is Karl Miklautz and I have been working on various programming projects during my Bachelor's and Master's studies. 
Most of them have been coded in Python due to their clear relation to data analysis for a scientific background. 
Here I like to present You some of them as part of this repository.
 
 ## Background
 
 My first coding experiences started at the age of 16, when I began to learn the basics in C. 
 Back then I was enrolled in the advanced computer science course offered by my high school. 
 After completing high school I enrolled in the undergraduate program ["Physics"](https://www.ph.tum.de/academics/bsc/curriculum_2008/) of the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de).
During this program my computer science and espacially my data analysis skills have improved drastically.
After completing the undergraduate course I enrolled into the Master's program ["Applied and Engineering Physics"](https://www.ph.tum.de/academics/msc/physics/), during which I started to mantain the IT infrastructure of the [DIM](http://dimiklautz.at).
Furthermore, I performed working student positions to enhance my laboratory and pratical skills.
